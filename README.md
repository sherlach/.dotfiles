Quick and dirty dump of some config files I'm messing with...

Has been tested on Gentoo install. But this is more of a WIP for my own benefit than anything to be used. Any suggestions, please let me know!

### TODO

Consider merging the update/download scripts into one main script that compares
the timestamps of different files, etc. before prompting the user to decide if 
they want to update based on that information.
