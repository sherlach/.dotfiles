Quick and dirty dump of some config files I'm messing with

(My new fully terminal based workflow. Using the cage compositor in wayland with
one alacritty window)

Has been tested on Gentoo minimal install, only needs a few deps to work. But this is more of a WIP for my own benefit than anything to be used. Any suggestions, please let me know!


rename the configs directory to customisations before using the bundled scripts
